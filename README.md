# Code Style

The JavaScript code in this project follows a consistent coding style to ensure readability and maintainability. Here are some key aspects of the code style:

- Variable and function names use camel case.
- Constants and values that are not expected to change are named using uppercase letters.
- Indentation is done using spaces (usually 2 or 4 spaces per level).
- Curly braces `{}` for control structures (if statements, loops, etc.) are placed on separate lines.
- Comments are used to explain the purpose of functions, variables, and code blocks.
- Descriptive variable and function names are used to enhance code clarity.
